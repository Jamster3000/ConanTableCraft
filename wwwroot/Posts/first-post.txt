# The First Update
So, the very first update post for this application. There isn't a lot to update you on.

The application is still in the development stages, and I am still working on it. Below are some things that I still have planned to work on for this before I can make this officially verion 1.0

## Planned Updates
- Some legal policies and tos (just to cover my back and give you all a basic idea of the legal things that are going on).
- Update the UI & design of the application as I understand that it might not look amazing. I am a programmer not a designer.
- I am considering adding ai text and image generation (Requires experimentation before I can confirm this).
- Provide insructions and guidance on how to use the application more clearly.
- Add static tabels that doesn't require random generation.
- Converting this web appliction into a desktop and mobile applcation too (because this website is magical like that).

There might be more features or plans in the future but this is currently what is in the works.

Please bare in mind that this is a side project fora  friend, I am only working on this in my free time. So, please be patient with me and the updating time of the application.

You can see more about this project on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Jamster3000/adventure-generator) page.

Thank you for your time and I hope you enjoy the application. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please let me know. I am always looking for ways to improve this application.
