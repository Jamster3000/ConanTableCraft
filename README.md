# Welcome to the Conan 2d20 adventure generator
> Currently under development
## what is this
This is a blazor Web Application built in C#. Used for the TTRPG: Conan 2d20. It is used to randomly generate elements from different tables from the `Gamemaster's Toolkit`.

## Why
I personally don't play and only have a partial grasp of the Conan 2d20 game. This was on request of a friend, and I decided to turn it into a learning phrase and learn the blazor framework whilst I am working on it.

## What else I intend to do with this project?
Once I mark this project as complete, I have a few other ideas for it. Since I am using blazor, I intend on turning it into a desktop and mobile application too! I haven't done this before either but it seems to be an easy thing.

## Installation Instructions
Currently, this is already hosted on Github Pages (yes blazor web app runs with Github Pages), you can access that at:
`https://jamster3000.github.io/adventure-generator/`
You can download the source code which does require the usual C# requirements (e.g., .NET, Blazor framework).

## How to contact the developer
There are a few different ways of contacting me:
- The web app also contains a form which you can leave your email address and a message.
- If you can find my email address, feel free to message me that way.
- DM me on Discord `Jamster1535`, although beware, I get a lot of random strangers message me there for some bizarre reason, so don't expect anything instant.
- You should be able to use the `Discussions` tab in this GitHub repository to bring any concerns up (I hope you can I've never used it before).
