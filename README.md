# Adventure generator
## Conan2d20

[Currently under development]

## what is this?
This Web application was made for a "friendly client". This program currently generates random entries from all the tables in the masters rule book. Not just totally randomly, but applies rules where applicable.

## what's planned for the future of this program
There are several things planned to make this program...awesome. see the issues and the project to see what us planned and what is being worked on.

In addition to this, because this is a blazor application (running on Web using wasm) it will (hopefully) be easy to transform into desktop application and mobile application which will come later within the next few months.
